# Nathan Mande's Site

Welcome to the repository of my personal website! ðŸš€

![screenshot](./src/public/imgs/screenshot.png)

Here, I'm showcasing my current room, almost exactly as it is. I must admit, I'm not one for loads of details in my workspace ðŸ˜….

I'm planning to improve some parts over time, and I'd love to hear your thoughts. Any feedback from you will be welcome!

Please take a moment to explore the [credit section](./src/content/notes/credits.md) for more details about the resources used in this project.

## Open-source

Despite being a personal space, I've chosen to keep my website open-source. Feel free to reuse any part of it as you see fit ðŸ˜Š.

## Known issues
